id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains an email. The emails will not contain uppercase letters.
 

Write a solution to delete all duplicate emails, keeping only one unique email with the smallest id.

For SQL users, please note that you are supposed to write a DELETE statement and not a SELECT one.

For Pandas users, please note that you are supposed to modify Person in place.

After running your script, the answer shown is the Person table. The driver will first compile and run your piece of code and then show the Person table. The final order of the Person table does not matter.

The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:

Input: 
Person table:
+----+------------------+
| id | email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
| 3  | john@example.com |
+----+------------------+
Output: 
+----+------------------+
| id | email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
+----+------------------+
Explanation: john@example.com is repeated two times. We keep the row with the smallest Id = 1.

Query 1 : Using Row_Number()

DELETE FROM Person 
WHERE id IN (
    SELECT a.id
    FROM (
        SELECT id, email,
               ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY email ORDER BY id) AS rn
        FROM Person
    ) a
    WHERE a.rn > 1
);

Explanation : 
1. In This Example ,We Select All Row And assign Rank to Each row with Column(Email) as Referecne :  id,Email ,rn
2. ID  Email  rn
    1   A      1
    2   A      2
    3   A      3
    4   B      1
    5   B      2
    6   C      1
3. Then Select All Those Id's ,Whose Rank is > 1
    ID  Email  rn
    2   A      2
    3   A      3
    5   B      2
4. Last We delete it. 

Learning Concept : 
1 . We Learn How To assign number to Row reference to coulm with similar Record...
2 . Row_Number():  Assigns a unique, sequential number to each row within a partition of a result set. The numbering starts at 1 and increases by 1 for each row in the specified order.
3. PARTITION BY : Divides the result set into groups (partitions) based on one or more columns.

Query 2 : Using JOIN

DELETE p2
FROM Person p1
JOIN Person p2
ON p1.Email = p2.Email
AND p1.id < p2.id;

Explanation : 
1. Here we are using self Join to Combine the table with it self.
2. We are Selection only Those Rows Where Emails are Same means duplicates.
3. And Then Futher Selecting Only those Rows 

id	Email
1	alice@mail.com
2	bob@mail.com
3	alice@mail.com
4	alice@mail.com
5	charlie@mail.com


p1.id	p1.Email	    p2.id	p2.Email
1	    alice@mail.com	3	    alice@mail.com
1	    alice@mail.com	4	    alice@mail.com
3	    alice@mail.com	4	    alice@mail.com
