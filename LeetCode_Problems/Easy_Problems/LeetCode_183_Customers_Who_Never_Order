Qstn : Write a solution to find all customers who never order anything.
       Return the result table in any order.
       The result format is in the following example.

Query : SELECT c.name as Customers FROM Customers c LEFT Join Orders o ON c.id = o.customerId 
        WHERE o.customerId IS NULL

Explanation : 
        1. "Left Join" Bcoz i want all the data from Customers table to check which of the Customers did not Order Any Thing Which is present in Order Table.
        2. "ON c.id = o.CustomerId" This Will Combine all the Records ,And Those Customers Who didnot Order Anything will get null in Order table Columns.
        3. "WHERE o.customerId IS NULL" Using this to Get only Which are null [means didnot order anything].
