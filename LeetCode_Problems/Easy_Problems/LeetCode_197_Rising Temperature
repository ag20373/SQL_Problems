Qstn : Write a solution to find all dates' id with higher temperatures compared to its previous     dates (yesterday).
       Return the result table in any order.

Query : SELECT w1.id
        FROM Weather AS w1
        INNER JOIN Weather AS w2
        ON DATEDIFF(DAY, w2.recordDate, w1.recordDate) = 1
        WHERE w1.temperature > w2.temperature;

Explanation : 
1. In This Problem, what We want To Compare the Temparature of Alternate day 
2. id     Date    Temp
    1       10      100
    2       11      120
    3       12      90
3. Comparing 10 with 20 , then 11 with 12 
4. here 120 > 100 , retuen 120.

Solution : 
1. Here , we wan to comapre two Dates presnt in same table
2. Indicating use Inner Join / Self Join
3. To compare Date We have DATEDIFF() method ...
    Example 10 and 11 have daydiff 1 , but 10 and 12 don't 
    Compare 10 and 11  but Dont compare 10 and 12.
4. The we are checking ,if the Temp of 10 is < Temp of 11  ,Return 11 id.
