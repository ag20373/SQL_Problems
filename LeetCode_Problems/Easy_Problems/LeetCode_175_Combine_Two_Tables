Qstn : Write a solution to report the first name, last name, city, and state of each person in the Person table. 
       If the address of a personId is not present in the Address table, report null instead.
       Return the result table in any order.

Query : SELECT firstName,lastName,city,state FROM Person as p LEFT JOIN Address as a ON p.personId = a.PersonId 

Reason : 
-> We Want the **City and State** of the Each person present in the  **Person Table**
-> If there is a Person Exist in the table **Person** whose state and city is not present in the 2nd Table 
-> We will print null for that case.

Explanation : 
1. I Left Join "Person" Table with "Address" Table which Means, I Will Consider Each Record on the Left Table and Only those Record on Right Table whose PersonId from right table present in the Left table column PersonId.

2. If a personId in the Left table is not present in the Right Table, Over all Result Will Display null in Right Table. 

Learning Concept :
1. Left Join : Consider All Rows From Left And Only Matching Rows From Right only.
