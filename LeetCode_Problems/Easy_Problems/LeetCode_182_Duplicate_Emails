Query : SELECT email as Email FROM Person GROUP BY email HAVING COUNT(email) > 1 

Reason :

Explanation : 
1. Here , We are Using "GROUP BY" to group all the same emails one after other  
2. then using "HAVING COUNT > 1" means return only those with count > 1
3. We cannot use aggregate Function with WHERE , that is why we use HAVING 
4. Also We cannot use HAVING With out GROUP BY


Learning Concept :
1. GROUP BY : Grouping all the same records as one like (1,1,1,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4,4)  
2. HANING Used for apply aggregate function ,Having cannot be used without GROUP BY
3. COUNT(column) : Return the Count of column 
4. COUNT(*) : Return all the columns.
